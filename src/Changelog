v0.1.2
    Added keyboard shortcuts for redo in the level editor (Ctrl+Y, or Ctrl+Shift+Z).
    Changed menus background.
    Changed colored stars outline.

    Minor fixes:
        Illegal level import format could crush the game.
        The game window starting size was constant and didn't match all screen sizes.
        And more...
